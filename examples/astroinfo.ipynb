      "Thoughts on Ideas:\n",
      "\n",
      "• Idea 1: Multimodal Galaxy Classification Using Spectroscopy and Imaging  \n",
      " - This idea has solid scientific value, leveraging both spectroscopy and imaging to potentially enhance galaxy classification accuracy.  \n",
      " - Pros:  \n",
      "  • Combines two complementary data modalities.  \n",
      "  • Likely to improve classification over using imagery alone.  \n",
      " - Cons:  \n",
      "  • Galaxy classification is a well-trodden area, so the novelty may be limited unless the method significantly innovates over existing techniques.  \n",
      "  • Calibration between the spectroscopic and imaging datasets could be challenging, leading to integration issues.  \n",
      " - Suggested improvements: Consider focusing on a less-explored classification domain (e.g., subclassifying ambiguous systems) or integrating physical parameters (like redshift or environment metrics) to distinguish the categories.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Idea 2: Identifying Rare Astronomical Objects with Multimodal Anomaly Detection  \n",
      " - This approach is intriguing because anomaly detection in a multimodal dataset could potentially uncover new phenomena.  \n",
      " - Pros:  \n",
      "  • Focuses on rare object discovery, which inherently carries high scientific impact.  \n",
      "  • Leverages the complementary strengths of spectral signatures and morphological details for robust anomaly identification.  \n",
      " - Cons:  \n",
      "  • Anomaly detection frameworks require careful threshold setting and validation—false positives might hinder scientific interpretation.  \n",
      "  • The lack of labeled anomalous events can make training and evaluation challenging.  \n",
      " - Suggested improvements: Clearly define anomaly criteria upfront, and consider incorporating unsupervised methods with robust validation strategies to mitigate false detections.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Idea 3: Mapping the Cosmic Web with Multimodal Data  \n",
      " - Mapping the cosmic web is a compelling scientific goal; combining redshift data from spectroscopy with imaging is a promising route.  \n",
      " - Pros:  \n",
      "  • Addresses the large-scale structure of the universe, a high-value target in cosmology.  \n",
      "  • Integrates spectroscopy to add depth (redshift information) unavailable in imaging-only data.  \n",
      " - Cons:  \n",
      "  • The current dataset might not cover a large enough cosmic volume or provide sufficient density for a robust cosmic web mapping, limiting its feasibility.  \n",
      "  • Computational challenges may arise when efficiently integrating 3D spatial information with high-dimensional image data.  \n",
      " - Suggested improvements: Ensure the dataset’s coverage is adequate for large-scale structure studies or consider focusing on limited sub-regions where data density is highest, and clarify the methodological approach for constructing the 3D map.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Idea 4: Star Formation History Reconstruction Using Multimodal Data  \n",
      " - Reconstructing star formation histories using both spectral features and imaging has potential but also faces notable challenges.  \n",
      " - Pros:  \n",
      "  • Combines different observational tracers (spectroscopy for stellar population indicators and imaging for morphological context).  \n",
      "  • May yield fresh insight into galaxy evolution processes.  \n",
      " - Cons:  \n",
      "  • Imaging data alone is typically less informative of star formation histories compared to detailed spectra, potentially limiting the contribution of the Euclid-only dataset.  \n",
      "  • The complexity of modeling star formation histories might require more detailed spectral coverage than what is available.  \n",
      " - Suggested improvements: More clearly define how spectral indices correlate with star formation metrics, and consider techniques (e.g., modeling spectral energy distributions) that better leverage the unique strengths of each data modality.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Idea 5: Multimodal Insights into Galaxy Evolution Across Cosmic Time  \n",
      " - This idea is ambitious and scientifically appealing, aiming to discern evolution trends by integrating spectral and imaging data.  \n",
      " - Pros:  \n",
      "  • Tackles a broad and impactful question in astrophysics by analyzing how galaxies change over time.  \n",
      "  • The synergistic use of multimodal data might uncover trends not visible when using one modality alone.  \n",
      " - Cons:  \n",
      "  • Potential issues with sample selection and redshift coverage in the dataset may complicate robust evolutionary analyses.  \n",
      "  • Without a well-defined theoretical framework, results might be too descriptive rather than offering clear causal insights.  \n",
      " - Suggested improvements: Develop a clear hypothesis or predictive framework for evolution trends and specify how the datasets’ redshift range and quality will support this analysis robustly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while all ideas offer interesting avenues, each would benefit from clearer focus on addressing the challenges inherent in integrating multimodal data and ensuring that the available dataset’s limitations (such as volume, depth, and coverage) are carefully considered.\n",

      "Thoughts on Ideas:\n",
      "\n",
      "• Idea 1: Multimodal Galaxy Classification Using Spectroscopy and Imaging (Refined)  \n",
      "  - Description: This idea focuses on classifying galaxies into underexplored categories (e.g., those with peculiar morphologies or unusual spectral features) by fusing DESI spectroscopy and Euclid imaging data, while also incorporating additional physical parameters such as star formation rates and metallicity.  \n",
      "  - Strengths:\n",
      "    • Innovative focus on seldom-studied galaxy types enhances novelty.  \n",
      "    • Integration of diverse physical parameters offers a multi-faceted perspective potentially yielding deeper astrophysical insights.  \n",
      "    • Clear use of multimodal data taps into the strengths of both imaging and spectroscopy.\n",
      "  - Weaknesses:\n",
      "    • The scope of “underexplored” classes may lead to limited sample sizes per class, possibly affecting model training robustness.  \n",
      "    • Calibration and integration of heterogeneous physical parameters may be challenging and require careful normalization and weighting.  \n",
      "    • It might be difficult to disentangle intrinsic properties from observational artifacts without rigorous cross-validation.\n",
      "  - Criteria Ranking:\n",
      "    • Scientific Merit: High (novelty, multi-parameter integration).  \n",
      "    • Feasibility: Moderate (challenges in data balancing and integration).  \n",
      "    • Originality: High.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Idea 2: Identifying Rare Astronomical Objects with Multimodal Anomaly Detection (Refined)  \n",
      "  - Description: This idea aims to detect rare or unusual astronomical objects by applying unsupervised anomaly detection (e.g., autoencoders and clustering algorithms) on combined DESI spectroscopy and Euclid imaging data, with anomaly criteria clearly defined by astrophysical markers such as extreme redshifts, unusual spectral lines, or rare morphological traits. A robust validation strategy involving cross-validation and expert review is also proposed.\n",
      "  - Strengths:\n",
      "    • Well-defined anomaly criteria provide a clear framework to focus on meaningful astrophysical outliers.  \n",
      "    • Utilization of unsupervised learning methods is well-suited to exploring unlabelled data where rare events are expected.  \n",
      "    • The strategy for cross-validation and expert review enhances scientific rigor.\n",
      "  - Weaknesses:\n",
      "    • The inherent complexity of anomaly detection might lead to a high rate of false positives, potentially complicating interpretation.  \n",
      "    • Reliance on expert review for validation increases the dependency on subjective assessments, which might affect consistency.  \n",
      "    • The absence of labeled anomalous cases may challenge the initial calibration of the detection algorithm.\n",
      "  - Criteria Ranking:\n",
      "    • Scientific Merit: High (potential for unexpected discoveries and new astrophysical insights).  \n",
      "    • Feasibility: Moderate to High (well-defined criteria and robust method, but false positives may be challenging).  \n",
      "    • Originality: High.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Idea 2 appears stronger due to its clear anomaly criteria and the innovative use of unsupervised learning techniques, which could lead to the discovery of unexpected phenomena. Although both ideas have commendable strengths, the potential high scientific impact of identifying new rare objects gives Idea 2 an edge, provided that the challenge of managing false positives is adequately addressed.\n",

      "### Importance of Using Multimodal Data for Anomaly Detection in Astronomical Objects\n",
      "\n",
      "Multimodal data, such as the combination of DESI spectroscopy and Euclid imaging, provides a richer and more comprehensive representation of astronomical objects compared to single-modality data. DESI spectroscopy captures detailed spectral information, including redshifts, chemical compositions, and physical conditions of celestial objects, while Euclid imaging provides high-resolution spatial and morphological data. By integrating these two modalities, it becomes possible to identify anomalies that may not be evident in either modality alone. For instance, an object with unusual spectral features but a typical morphology, or vice versa, might be overlooked in single-modality analyses but can be detected in a multimodal framework.\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of multimodal data is particularly important in the context of anomaly detection, as rare or unusual objects often exhibit subtle deviations across multiple dimensions. These deviations may manifest differently in spectral and imaging data, and their combined analysis can enhance sensitivity to such anomalies. Furthermore, multimodal embeddings can capture complex relationships between spectral and imaging features, potentially revealing new classes of objects or phenomena.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Hypotheses and Assumptions\n",
      "\n",
      "The project is based on the following hypotheses and assumptions:\n",
      "1. **Multimodal embeddings capture richer information**: The combination of DESI spectroscopy and Euclid imaging data in a shared embedding space will provide a more nuanced representation of astronomical objects, enabling the detection of anomalies that are not apparent in single-modality embeddings.\n",
      "2. **Anomalies in multimodal data are more scientifically interesting**: Objects identified as anomalous in the multimodal embedding space are hypothesized to represent more complex or novel phenomena compared to those identified using Euclid imaging alone.\n",
      "3. **Density estimation in embedding space is effective for anomaly detection**: A density estimator, such as a normalizing flow, can effectively model the distribution of embeddings and identify low-likelihood regions corresponding to rare objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Benefits of Comparing Multimodal and Euclid-Only Anomalies\n",
      "\n",
      "Comparing anomalies detected in multimodal embeddings with those identified using Euclid-only embeddings offers several benefits:\n",
      "- **Validation of multimodal approach**: If multimodal anomalies include objects that are not detected in the Euclid-only analysis, it would validate the added value of incorporating spectral data.\n",
      "- **Characterization of anomalies**: The comparison can help characterize the nature of anomalies, distinguishing between those driven by spectral features, imaging features, or their combination.\n",
      "- **Scientific insights**: Differences in the anomalies identified by the two approaches may provide insights into the limitations of single-modality analyses and highlight the importance of multimodal data for understanding complex astronomical phenomena.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Data Characteristics and Preprocessing Assumptions\n",
      "\n",
      "The multimodal dataset combines DESI spectroscopy and Euclid imaging data, while the Euclid-only dataset includes imaging data alone. Key characteristics and preprocessing considerations include:\n",
      "- **Spectral data**: DESI spectroscopy provides high-dimensional data with features such as flux values across different wavelengths. Preprocessing may involve normalization, noise reduction, and feature extraction (e.g., principal component analysis or autoencoders) to reduce dimensionality and enhance signal-to-noise ratio.\n",
      "- **Imaging data**: Euclid imaging data consists of high-resolution images capturing the spatial and morphological properties of objects. Preprocessing steps may include resizing, normalization, and augmentation to ensure consistency and robustness in embedding generation.\n",
      "- **Alignment of modalities**: For the multimodal dataset, it is crucial to ensure that the spectral and imaging data are correctly aligned for each object. This may involve matching objects based on identifiers or spatial coordinates.\n",
      "- **Handling missing data**: Some objects may have incomplete data in one or both modalities. Strategies such as imputation or exclusion of incomplete samples may be necessary, depending on the extent of missing data.\n",
      "\n",
      "By addressing these considerations, the project aims to leverage the strengths of multimodal data to identify rare and unusual astronomical objects, providing new insights into the diversity of the universe.\n",

      "The astroPT model is a state-of-the-art framework designed for multimodal astronomical data analysis. It is capable of integrating data from different modalities, such as spectroscopy and imaging, into a unified embedding space. The process for generating embeddings is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Input Data Preparation**:\n",
      "   - For the multimodal dataset, the DESI spectroscopy data and Euclid imaging data will be preprocessed separately. Spectral data will undergo normalization and dimensionality reduction (if necessary), while imaging data will be resized and normalized to ensure compatibility with the astroPT model's input requirements.\n",
      "   - For the Euclid-only dataset, only the imaging data will be preprocessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Model Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The astroPT model will be configured to accept both spectral and imaging data for the multimodal dataset. The model architecture typically includes separate feature extractors for each modality (e.g., convolutional layers for images and dense layers for spectra) followed by a fusion mechanism to combine the extracted features into a shared embedding space.\n",
      "   - For the Euclid-only dataset, the model will be used in a single-modality configuration, processing only the imaging data.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Embedding Extraction**:\n",
      "   - After training or fine-tuning the astroPT model on the respective datasets, embeddings will be extracted from the penultimate layer of the model. These embeddings represent a compressed, high-level representation of the input data, capturing both spectral and imaging features for the multimodal dataset and only imaging features for the Euclid-only dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Anomaly Detection Using Density Estimation**\n",
      "To identify rare or unusual objects, a density estimator will be trained on the embedding space to model the distribution of the data. The specific steps are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Choice of Density Estimator**:\n",
      "   - A normalizing flow model will be used as the density estimator. Normalizing flows are a class of generative models that transform a simple base distribution (e.g., Gaussian) into a complex target distribution using a series of invertible transformations. They are well-suited for high-dimensional data and can provide exact likelihood estimates, making them ideal for anomaly detection.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Training the Density Estimator**:\n",
      "   - The normalizing flow will be trained on the embeddings generated by the astroPT model. The training objective is to maximize the likelihood of the embeddings under the model, ensuring that the density estimator accurately captures the distribution of the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Anomaly Scoring**:\n",
      "   - Once trained, the density estimator will assign a likelihood score to each embedding. Objects with low likelihood scores (i.e., those located in low-density regions of the embedding space) will be flagged as anomalies.\n",

      "- **Characterization of Anomalies**: By comparing the two sets of anomalies, it will be possible to determine whether certain anomalies are driven by spectral features, imaging features, or their combination.\n",
      "- **Scientific Insights**: Differences in the anomalies identified by the two approaches may highlight the limitations of single-modality analyses and underscore the importance of multimodal data for understanding complex astronomical phenomena.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Baseline Approaches and Reference Models**\n",
      "To validate the effectiveness of the astroPT model and the normalizing flow density estimator, the following baseline approaches will be considered:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Single-Modality Models**:\n",
      "   - For the Euclid-only dataset, a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained solely on imaging data will serve as a baseline for embedding generation.\n",
      "   - For the multimodal dataset, a model that processes spectral and imaging data independently (without fusion) will be used as a baseline.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Alternative Density Estimators**:\n",
      "   - Other density estimation techniques, such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), will be tested to compare their performance with normalizing flows.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Random Anomaly Detection**:\n",
      "   - A random anomaly detection approach, where objects are flagged as anomalies based on random sampling, will serve as a control to ensure that the detected anomalies are not due to chance.\n",

      "This code performs preprocessing for both the multimodal (DESI spectroscopy + Euclid imaging) and Euclid-only datasets. It loads the datasets from HuggingFace, performs initial data quality checks (summary statistics, missing data, outlier visualization), normalizes the DESI spectra (per-object, robust to outliers), applies PCA for dimensionality reduction, resizes and normalizes Euclid images to 64x64 with pixel values in [0,1], and aligns modalities by excluding incomplete entries. The processed data and summary statistics are saved in the `data/` directory, and all key statistics are printed in full. Outlier histograms for spectra and image pixel distributions are saved as high-resolution PNGs.\n",

It loads the datasets from HuggingFace, performs data quality checks (summary statistics, missing data, outlier visualization), normalizes the DESI spectra (per-object, robust to outliers), applies PCA for dimensionality reduction, resizes and normalizes Euclid images to 64x64 with pixel values in [0,1], and aligns modalities by excluding incomplete entries. The processed data and summary statistics are saved in the data/ directory, and all key statistics are printed in full. Outlier histograms for spectra and image pixel distributions are saved as high-resolution PNGs.\n",

      "This script preprocesses both the multimodal (DESI spectroscopy + Euclid imaging) and Euclid-only datasets. It loads the datasets from HuggingFace, performs data quality checks (summary statistics, missing data, outlier visualization), normalizes the DESI spectra (per-object, robust to outliers), applies PCA for dimensionality reduction, resizes and normalizes Euclid images to 64x64 with pixel values in [0,1], and aligns modalities by excluding incomplete entries. The processed data and summary statistics are saved in the `data/` directory, and all key statistics are printed in full. Outlier histograms for spectra and image pixel distributions are saved as high-resolution PNGs.\n",

      "This script preprocesses both the multimodal (DESI spectroscopy + Euclid imaging) and Euclid-only datasets. It loads the datasets from HuggingFace, performs data quality checks (summary statistics, missing data, outlier visualization), normalizes the DESI spectra (per-object, robust to outliers), applies PCA for dimensionality reduction, resizes and normalizes Euclid images to 64x64 with pixel values in [0,1], and aligns modalities by excluding incomplete entries. The processed data and summary statistics are saved in the `data/` directory, and all key statistics are printed in full. Outlier histograms for spectra and image pixel distributions are saved as high-resolution PNGs.\n",
